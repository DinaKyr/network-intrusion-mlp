In the making of an MLP or other ML model that predicts whether network traffic is normal or not, thus a possible intrusion.
Dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sampadab17/network-intrusion-detection

Stage: Ready for the first try on real data

I have trained both an MLP neural network and a Random Forest model to evaluate and compare their performance.
The models are saved in packages with their previous tuning, meaning the packages can be applied in other datasets applying the same reasoning and preprocessing.
